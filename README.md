## Description
Shop Shop redux is a refactor assignment from a full-stack development course at the University of Minnesota. This assignment required refactoring a globalState react context to react-redux. Redux allows applications to have global state preventing the need for prop drilling from one component to the next. Prop drilling is basically a situation when the same data is being sent at almost every level due to requirements in the final level.
